# Courses Management Application

This is a demonstration application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that showcases CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against a JSON file as a data store. It provides a simple but functional course management system with a modern UI.

## Features

- **Create** new courses with titles, descriptions, and estimated completion times
- **Read** course information from a local JSON data store
- **Update** existing course details
- **Delete** courses
- Clean, responsive UI built with Next.js App Router and React

## Technology Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- JSON file-based data storage (as a database alternative for demonstration)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm as your package manager

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd courses-management-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
   This variable is used to ensure API routes work correctly in both development and production environments.

## Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## How It Works

The application stores course data in a JSON file located in the project. The API routes in the `app/api` directory handle CRUD operations by reading from and writing to this JSON file.

- **List Courses**: The home page fetches and displays all courses
- **View Course**: Click on a course to view its details
- **Create Course**: Use the "Add Course" button to create a new course
- **Edit Course**: Click the "Edit" button on a course details page
- **Delete Course**: Click the "Delete" button on a course details page

## Project Structure

- `app/page.tsx`: Home page with course listings
- `app/courses/[id]/page.tsx`: Course details page
- `app/courses/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Edit course page
- `app/api/courses/route.ts`: API endpoint for getting all courses and creating new ones
- `app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts`: API endpoint for getting, updating, and deleting specific courses
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `data/courses.json`: JSON file that serves as the data store

## Learning Points

This project demonstrates:

1. Next.js App Router architecture
2. Server and client components in Next.js
3. Handling asynchronous operations
4. Type safety with TypeScript
5. Simple file-based data persistence
6. API route implementation
7. Form handling in React
